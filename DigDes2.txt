Verilog
Structural Design
	structure of circuit
	must be analized to determine behavior
	specific and detailed on a gate level
	more accurate for timing considerations (not important now)
	more time consuming to write

Verilog
Module
	a defined part, schematic, equation
	contains inputs and outputs
	can be combined or resued inside other modules
Xilinx "New Source" dialogs automate creation of the structure with inputs/outputs

module moduleName(
	input VariableName,
	input VariableName,
	output VariableName,
	output VariableName
	);
//My Stuff happens here
endmodule

Comments 
	ignored by synthesis
	use to explain code
	show up in Xilinx as green text
	//Single line comment
	/* Multi line comment */

Bitwise Operators
	~ 	NOT
	&	AND
	| 	OR
	^	XOR

Assignment Statements
	=		store right into left
			F = A & B;
			(just like all other languages)
			assignment statements are evaluated in order writen
			ORDER MATTERS
	<=	
			F <= A & B;
			everything to right is evaluated and then assigned to left
			groups of assignment statements are evaluated at the same time
			ORDER DOESN'T MATTER
	assign =
			assign F = A & B;
			Everything to right is continouslly evaluated and assigned to variable on the left
			re-evaluated everytime A or B changes
			ORDER DOESN'T MATTER
unknown state exists!
