test on thursday
some mult choice simmilar to practice homework (1/2)
	30 questions worth 50%
other  half is writing code
can be any part (probably 3 things)
	simmulation
	behavioral
	structural
~3 problems worth 50%
	
shift register
multiple inputs/outputs
typically buses(power of 2)
sometime have same number of inputs and outputs(for us usually the same)
control inputs
output is manipulated based on control inputs

Controls
direction to shift (R or L)
Fill bit
rotate
number of places to shift

ex
d:0  (direction)(0=left, 1 = right)
f:0  (fill bit)	(fill w/ 0)
r:0  (rotate)	(dont rotate)
s1:0 (2s digit of shift)	(places to shift)
s2:0 (1s digit of shift)	(places to shift)
input: 10110010
output:10110010

d:0
f:0
r:0
s1:1 
s0:0 
(shift 2 bits left)
input:	10110010
output:	11001000

(if rotate, fill doesn't matter)

d:0
f:0
r:1
s1:1
s0:0

input:	10110010
outpu: 	11001010
shift registers are very important for cryptography

modules can be made of combinations of other modules
structural design to connect to the different modules together
smaller modules can be behavioral or structural

example 4:1
in examples (project should work)

bit slice
complex part can be built from groups of bit pieces
only works if same action is repeated on each bit of a part

comparitor
2 n-bit inputs (a and b) 
3 1-bit outputs (lt, gt, eq)
only 1 output goes high at a time
	if a<b lt=1
	if a>b gt=1
	if a=b eq=1
a=01011010
b=11001110

0: 0=0 	so 		a=b
1: 1=1 	no chage 	a=b
2: 0<1 	so now		a<b
3: 1=1 	no change 	a<b
4: 1>0 	now		a>b
5: 0=0 	no change	a>b
6: 1=1 	no change	a>b
7: 0<1	now		a<b

each bit needs the following information:
a and b input bits
GT, LT, EQ from previus bit

dont need every combo, if 1 output is 1, the others are 0
for comparisons input = output ( if they are the same)
only way to get equal out, is if you have equal in
cannot set equal, just pass it onto the next one
